                \n1. --- Notes
                    This project was made by kfmrc0 for fun and for personal use. eventually want
                    to learn spring and spring boot for a web app with similar use or application
                    of this program. any formulas or equations involved were found on the web. in
                    my (Kfmrc0) opinion, this kind of info should be accessible and free without
                    any annoying pop-ups, sign-ups, or paywalls. thanks
